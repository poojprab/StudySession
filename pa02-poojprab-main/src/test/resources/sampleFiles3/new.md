- only creates a reference
- no array has  actually been created yet

- General form:  arrayName = new type[numberOfElements];


# Vectors
- Vectors act like resizable arrays

## Declaring a vector
- General Form: Vector<type> v = new Vector();
- type needs to be a valid reference type

## Adding an element to a vector
- v.add(object of type);
