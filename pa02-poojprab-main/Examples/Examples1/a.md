# Vectors
- [[Vectors act like resizable arrays]].

## Declaring a vector
- [[General Form: Vector<type> v = new Vector();]]
- Example: Vector<Integer> v = new Vector();

- [[type needs to be a valid reference type]]
- [[What is the longest river in Europe?:::The longest river is the Volga River.]]
- [[Which country is famous for its tulips and windmills?:::

- [[What is the capital of Argentina?:::

## Adding an element to a vector
- [[v.add(object of type);]]

- Reminder - go back and review clearing a vector!
